# Advent Of Code 2024

My solutions for AOC 2024. I'll try to switch programming languages every now and then.
Or maybe I'll just stick with python...

```bash
.      *    *           *.       *   .                      *     .
               .   .                   __   *    .     * .     *
    *       *         *   .     .    _|__|_        *    __   .       *
  .  *  /\       /\          *        ('')    *       _|__|_     .
       /  \   * /  \  *          .  <( . )> *  .       ('')   *   *
  *    /  \     /  \   .   *       _(__.__)_  _   ,--<(  . )>  .    .
      /    \   /    \          *   |       |  )),`   (   .  )     *
   *   `||` ..  `||`   . *.   ... ==========='`   ... '--`-` ... * jb .
```

- Day 1: I forgot to set up proper boundaries for my mergesort implementation and I was getting a lower number for part 1.
- Day 2: I had a stupid error in which I wasn't using the proper parameter in the function definition lol.
- Day 3: I should learn regex man.
- Day 4: I spent a lot of time making functions that overcomplicated the problem :/
- Day 5: I had a "smart" idea but I should've done my first idea instead... That one worked. Also, bogosort lmao.
- Day 6: Bruteforce let's gooo!
- Day 7: It was pretty ok.
- Day 8: I forgot to count the antennas so I wasted 20 minutes.
- Day 9: I decided to do it in C, I can't do part 2... I need to do it once I'm rested.
- Day 10: TDB.
- Day 11: I spent a lot of time debuging because I mixed up ints and strings. I also didn't think of using DP so I looked up hints on Reddit.
